Notes

  - "required" fields are not used as recommended by Google to keep forward-compatibility:
    https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#simple

  - the related Java files are not generated during build. Indeed the existing protoc maven
    plugins require protobuf to be installed on boxes. That means that generated Java files
    are updated and committed for each change (see src/main/gen-java).
